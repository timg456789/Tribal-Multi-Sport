					details: "I have always enjoyed sports since as far back as I can remember. Growing up my focus was on tennis and I loved long matches as well as the endurance and fitness aspect of the sport. In middle school and high school I ran both cross country and track. However, during college and for a few years after graduation, I just stuck to the gym and did very little running causing my cardio fitness to drop off significantly. Then a close friend challenged me to a half marathon and the rest is history. I finished that half marathon which then turned into a gateway for my pursuit of multisport racing. Shortly thereafter, I started with a sprint triathlon that included a very ugly breast stroke, a road bike and very little knowledge of gear or strategy. That first triathlon was an eye opener and I knew I needed professional guidance to have any chance of improved results. I then had the opportunity to meet Jon and immediately realized what a positive difference his expertise in all aspects of multisport could bring to my racing and personal life. After a few months of working with Jon, I completed the Austin, TX 70.3. In 2013, I completed 4 70.3 races (Haines City, Williamsburg, Augusta, Anderson) and numerous other races (Xterra, road running races). After nearly two years of coaching, Jon's advice, guidance and analysis in swim, run, bike, nutrition, gear, the gym, mental outlook and overall strategy continue to ensure that my training and race results improve beyond my own expectations. If you are serious and willing to make the personal commitment for better results, then I can ensure you that Jon will make a tremendous positive impact on you results."

					details: "I was no track star in high school, that's for sure. Nope, I was on the other side of high school stereotypes- I was a Thespian: a singer, dancer, actor who thought sweating was only necessary when the stage lights were on- and in a full face of makeup. Fast forward a few years, I watched my then neighbor, now husband, race his first triathlon. Strangely, I saw a similar thread running through triathlon and musical theater. It's the act of performing, the pre-race jitters, the post race elation, and constant self assessment in the pursuit of getting better. And it was these emotions that I missed from my performing days that lead me to toe the line...staring into the water like it was going to eat me alive. And, subsequently, feeling exactly like the curtain was about to go up. I have been training and racing ever since. And, as in stage performance, there have been forgotten lines and standing ovations along the journey. I have attempted every distance, and I have struggled with the term 'Athlete'. But after 5 years of racing, I can say that I am an athlete and a performer. And a business owner (LindsayDoesMakeup.com), and a wife, and a dog mom and hopefully a good friend to the fantastic team I'm apart of. Ya know, It's kinda like a show, it's takes whole cast and crew to makes an amazing performance...."

					details: "I had been cycling for a few months with a buddy who convinced me to register for the Gator Sprint. The funny thing is we both won our AG because we were the only ones who showed up. It didnâ€™t take long for me to be humbled and to fall in love with the sport. I train and race Triathlon because I love the challenge of trying to exceed my limitations. I love trying to manage the endless physical, mental and spiritual layers involved with growth and trying to beat my primary competitor which is me. I love the community and having the opportunity to be around people who are doing it right."

					details: "As a 2 time Ironman 70.3 qualifier. Prior to training with Jon Noland I was middle of the pack age group. Training on my own and not really a good understanding of the sport of triathlon. I lacked the knowledge, focus and discpline for what it takes to be a competitive triathlete. Since training with Jon and team I have qualified the past 2 years for the Ironman 70.3 World Championship. The last 2 years I have been selected by the USAT All American Honorable mention. The structure and the discipline was something I was lacking when training on my own. Since I met Jon Noland, I have been improving by leaps in bounds. As a relative new Triathlete 5 years in the sport I have been training with Jon Noland now for 3 years. He has helped me gain the knowledge and structure to make me a competitive age group athlete. Without the training and discipline there would have been no way I could have qualified for the Ironman World Championship not once but even back to back (2012, 2013)."

					details: "Growing up in Montreal endurance sports weren't anywhere in the lime light and hockey was considered the holy grail. I never would have thought that the sport of triathlon would enter my life until four years ago after I did my first 5k. Like everyone else, it was hook, line, and sinker and I was on that multi-sport train for the rest of my life. Having finished several sprint triathlons I didn't think I was making any gains and searched out for some professional guidance. I would like to think of it more as an SOS! :) <br /><br />Jon Noland and I have been together for a while and we are now entering our 4th season together as team. Since I've started working with him I can finally say I've competed in every triathlon distance (except IM which I will do this March). It's because of his knowledge, guidance, and motivating attitude that I have seen nothing but improvements from training sessions to out on the race course. His famous quote that I still live by \"Talents and abilities get realized every day\"."

					details: "Born and raised in Miami, FL. Univ of Miami varsity track + field (primarily high jump) Class of 1994 Internal Medicine physician After my third child was born I though it would be fun to do a triathlon. I enjoy a spectrum of triathlon distances sprint thru Ironman, plus marathons/ultras in the \"off\" season. I'd love to do Norseman Extreme some day and hope to get a 100 mile run in 2015 (Umstead maybe) Currently training for my first Double Iron (the Florida Double Anvil)."
