			<p>
				As an athlete and as a coach, my approach has always been simple - focus on the process,
				put in the work and you will see the results. By paying attention to the details and
				training and racing in an intelligent and not just aggressive manner, gains will be made
				and success will be realized. I have applied this approach to myself as an athlete over the
				years and have been able to train and race at a very high level. I have competed and placed
				at Regional, National and World Championship events for the Sprint, Olympic and 70.3 distances.
				I have been a USAT All-American for 5 consecutive years, member of Team USA and have held Florida
				age group state records for open 5K, 10K and 13.1 distance runs. Working as a full time multi-sport
				coach for the past several years I have worked with athletes of varying ages and abilities - from first timers to elites -
				and have had great success preparing people for all levels and distances of competition. I focus on creating fitter,
				faster and smarter athletes by addressing individual needs, identifying limiters and turning them into strengths.

				You aren't just another "athlete" or another "race entry". There isn't a cookie cutter training program that will give
				the same measurable results across the board. A very unique pair of feet fills your shoes. I'll be with you every step of the way, designing your
				training plan around your life and your goals.
			</p>
			<p>
				My mission is not only to enhance your strengths but to determine your limiting factors. I believe knowledge is power, which is why I never stop
				learning, pushing beyond all limits. Weather I'm working on your swim form, nutritional habits or 20 min FTP, I'm going to develop you into the
				best version of YOU that is possible. Having worked my way into the ranks of the professional field in only 3 years,
				I know my hard work and knowledge base is proven. The TRIBAL Multi-Sport Team is poised for success!
